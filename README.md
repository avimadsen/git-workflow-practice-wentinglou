An Investigation of the Therac-25 Accidents https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/274940

## Article Summary
This article introduces the Therac-25 accident and the cause of the accident. The authors demonstrate the complex nature of accidents and the need to investigate all aspects of system development and operation in order to prevent future accidents. The authors also present some lessons learned in terms of system engineering, software engineering, and government regulation of safety-critical systems containing software components. It is important to consider the safty of system, such as concurrency and overflow, and document the code nicely when we develop a software.

##Note from Avi Madsen
## I had never heard of the Therac-25 medical electron accelerator and never considered that faulty software engineer could result in lives lost. Fascinating article! Switched to a working branch so edits could be merged, sorry about that.
